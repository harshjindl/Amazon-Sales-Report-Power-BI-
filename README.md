**Situation:**
I analyzed a dataset consisting of more than **1,OO,000+** entries. The dataset included various columns such as Order ID, Date, Status, Fulfilment, Sales Channel, Ship Service Level, Style, SKU, Category, Size, ASIN, Courier Status, Quantity, Currency, Amount, Ship City, Ship State, Ship Postal Code, Ship Country, Promotion IDs, B2B, Fulfilled By, and an unnamed column. The primary goal of the analysis was to identify **key performance indicators (KPIs)**, perform thorough **data cleaning, and create visualizations** and **dashboards** to get actionable insights into sales performance.

**Action:**

**Data Cleaning:**

Removed Blank Columns: Eliminated any columns that were entirely blank to streamline the dataset.
Handled NaN Values: Addressed missing values by either removing rows with NaNs or imputing them based on the context.

**Key Performance Indicators:**

Identified relevant KPIs such as **average B2B sales**, **sales by category**, **sales trends by month**, **top-performing states**, and **order status distribution**.
**Data Visualization and Dashboard Design:**

**Stacked Bar Chart** for Average B2B Sales in Top 3 States: This visualization highlighted the average B2B sales in the top three states, providing insights into regional performance.

**Stacked Bar Chart** for Sales by Category: Displayed sales distribution across different categories, helping to identify the most and least popular product categories.

**Line Chart for Sales by Month**: Illustrated sales trends over time, enabling the identification of seasonal patterns and peaks in sales.

**Line Chart for Top-Performing States**: Showcased the sales performance of top-performing states, allowing for a comparative analysis.

**Donut Chart for Order Status: **Represented the distribution of order statuses, aiding in understanding the fulfillment efficiency and order lifecycle.

**Resolution:**

The data analysis and visualization provided comprehensive insights into the sales performance across various dimensions. The dashboards enabled stakeholders to:
Identify Key Trends: Easily spot trends and patterns in sales data, facilitating better decision-making.

**Understand Regional Performance:** Gain clarity on which states were driving the most B2B sales, allowing for targeted marketing and sales strategies.

**Assess Category Performance:** Determine the popularity and performance of different product categories, guiding inventory and product development decisions.

**Monitor Order Fulfillment:** Track the efficiency of order fulfillment processes and address any issues related to order statuses.
